          <br>
          We are living in an age where tasks and systems are fusing together with the power of IOT to have a more
          efficient system of working and to execute jobs quickly! With all the power at our finger tips this is what we
          have come up with.

          The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently and seamlessly a large number of
          different systems, while providing data for millions of people to use and capitalize. Building a general
          architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of
          devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system.

          One of the main concerns with our environment has been solid waste management which impacts the health and
          environment of our society. The detection, monitoring and management of wastes is one of the primary problems
          of the present era. The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a cumbersome
          process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which can easily be avoided with our present
          technologies.

          This is our solution, a method in which waste management is automated. This is our IoT Garbage Monitoring
          system, an innovative way that will help to keep the cities clean and healthy.

          Follow on to see how you could make an impact to help clean your community, home or even surroundings, taking
          us a step closer to a better way of living : )
        </p>

        <p><strong style="font-size: 130%">II. OVERVIEW of the Monitoring System</strong>
          The idea struck us when we observed that the garbage truck use to go around the town to collect solid waste
          twice a day. Although this system was thorough it was very inefficient. For example let's say street A is a
          busy street and we see that the garbage fills up really fast whereas maybe street B even after two days the
          bin isn't even half full. This example is something that actually happens thus it lead us to the ''Eureka''
          moment!
          <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
          What our system does is it gives a real time indicator of the garbage level in a trashcan at any given time.
          Using that data we can then optimize waste collection routes and ultimately reduce fuel consumption. It allows
          trash collectors to plan their daily/weekly pick up schedule.
        </p>
        <p><strong style="font-size: 130%">III. The basic Model works like so...</strong>
          To start with you will first have to enter the height of the dustbin. This will help us generate the
          percentage of trash in the trashcan. We then have two criterias which needs to be satisfied to show that the
          particular bin needs to be emptied :

          The amount of trash, in other words let's say if your bin is half full you don't really need to empty it. Our
          thresh, or maximum amount that we permit of trash, is 75% of the bin. (You could alter the thresh according to
          your preference.)
          If supposing a particular trashcan fills up 20% and then for a week doesn't change, it comes into our second
          criteria, time. With time even the little amount will start rotting leading to a smelly surrounding. To avoid
          that our tolerance level is 2 days, so if a trashcan is less than 75% but it is two days old it then will also
          need to be emptied.
          With these criterias in mind let's understand the technical part:

          An ultrasonic sensor (A.K.A a distance sensor) will be placed on the interior side of the lid, the one facing
          the solid waste. As trash increases, the distance between the ultrasonic and the trash decreases. This live
          data will be sent to our micro-controller.
          Our micro- controller then processes the data and through the help of WiFi sends it to an app.
          What the app does it visually represents the amount of trash in the bin with a small animation.
          This process will indicate all the bins which require attention, leading the user to take the most effective
          route.

          <br>
          In modern public utilities, a whole range of measures is provided for the collection, processing, utilization
          and disposal of household waste. Waste management activities include waste sorting, recycling of some of the
          household waste, composting, waste incineration, and deep transformation. Ultimately, all these measures
          should help to reduce the amount of waste to be disposed of.
          According to the World Bank, every year humanity produces just over 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste
          (MSW). By 2050, this figure threatens to rise to 3.4 billion tons. Countries deal with the problem
          differently. For example, in Japan, the population independently disassembles garbage into dozens of
          categories, the inhabitants of India are just learning not to throw it out just on the street, and Italian
          cities now and then find themselves on the verge of garbage collapse.
          The problem of waste disposal is especially relevant in cities. When trash is sorted correctly, it becomes a
          source of raw materials that can be reused. For example, from biowaste - foliage, herbs, peels of vegetables
          and fruits, etc. - make fertilizers for plants or use them for biogas production. And valuable metals are
          extracted from old household appliances: gold, silver, copper or aluminum. Old furniture, clothing and plastic
          are also used as recyclable materials.
          Large cities consume enormous amounts of energy. It is needed in industrial production, infrastructure,
          households: for heating, electricity, mobility. Garbage in all of this can replace non-renewable energy
          sources. One example is the biogas already mentioned above. Another example: energy generated from waste
          processing
          <br>

          is used for heating households. This technology was successfully mastered in Copenhagen.
          95 percent of plastic packaging is for single use. A third of it ends up in the sea and on land, polluting the
          environment. Experts from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation have calculated that by 2050, if the situation does
          not change, there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans.
          Garbage that is difficult and costly to dispose of includes special types of plastic. Such plastic is used,
          for example, in disposable packaging, plastic cups, bags in supermarkets or cocktail tubes are made from it.
          It consists of approximately 95 percent of the disposable packaging material. In Europe, they plan to
          completely abandon all this. Instead of plastic bags, supermarkets offer paper bags. Disposable tableware
          disappears from sale. It is replaced with dishes made of other materials.
          A third of all food products produced, according to the UN, are not used. Most of them deteriorate during
          transportation and storage. Tons of food end up in trash cans every day: these are not only those products
          that were not bought in the store, but also those that turned out to be too much in the plate and in the
          refrigerator. In this case, experts say, you need to be guided by the well-known principle: less is better.
          In the modern world, in order to avoid pollution and to recycle more waste, special trash bins have been
          created, which are divided into compartments. They can be observed in offices and enterprises, even in
          ordinary residential buildings.
          <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          Office rubbish is very diverse. Most of it is usually made up of paper, cardboard and plastic. The key
          principle that it is advisable to adhere to in this case is that a container for separate collection of
          garbage in the office should be compact, functional and, being in the room, organically fit into the interior.
          This also means certain design requirements for capacity. Modern models of such office bins look very modern
          and elegant. If we are talking about office premises, then it is advisable to install at least 2 garbage cans
          in them - one for recyclable and the other for mixed waste (food plastic, food waste, tea bags, etc.), so as
          not to contaminate recyclable materials.
          The question of how to organize separate waste collection at an enterprise is relevant for almost any business
          entity. For the primary accumulation of separately collected waste, it is advisable to install blocks of
          colored urns at the enterprise. For the accumulation of a transport consignment of waste, containers made of
          high-strength plastic with a volume of 120 to 1100 liters (depending on the scale of the enterprise and the
          volume of waste produced) are optimal. It also makes sense to equip containers with a special press for
          compaction of garbage, which, when removed, will allow loading much larger volumes. Waste management
          specialists recommend in this case to install at least 3 colored containers.
          But such garbage cans have not yet been introduced in the streets of the courtyards of residential buildings.
          Accordingly, small garbage cans fill up very quickly, especially in areas where there is a lot of traffic. The
          presence of trash cans does not guarantee that there will be no contamination. All this leads to the fact that
          garbage is simply carried through the air, polluting the environment. Especially in the peripheral areas of
          even large cities of Kazakhstan, the following picture is often observed: the absence of tanks and even if
          available, garbage collection is emphasized in the city center.
          Also, due to the lack of garbage cans, garbage is thrown into small tanks with water or into drainage water,
          which creates blockages. During the rainy season, these blockages damage the water system and then the water
          overflows over the roads. In some areas, overflow water blocks all transport routes or small floods occur
          within the city. Open rubbish bins pose problems for people living in the area as they become a breeding
          ground for insects such as mosquitoes, germs, etc., which spread many diseases. These open waste areas create
          unsanitary conditions in these areas.

          In many of these areas, trash cans are not emptied at regular intervals, which means they are not being
          cleaned properly. To avoid this, intelligent waste management and monitoring systems should be implemented.

          Waste bin management systems have been developed and one of them is Smart Garbage Bins.
          IoT or Internet Things refers to the network of connected physical objects that can
          communicate and exchange data among themselves without the desideratum of any human
          intervention. It has been formally defined as an “Infrastructure of Information Society”
          because IoT sanctions us to amass information from all kind of mediums such as humans,
          animals, conveyances, kitchen appliances. Thus, any object in the physical world which can
          be provided with an IP address to enable data transmission over a network can be made part
          of IoT system by embedding them with electronic hardware such as sensors, software and
          networking gear. IoT is different than Internet as in a way it transcends Internet connectivity
          by enabling everyday objects that utilizes embedded circuits to interact and communicate
          with each other utilizing the current Internet infrastructure.

          The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaping and touching our lives in every sphere. IoT based garbage monitoring
          system is an innovative project idea for maintaining the clean environment of the city. The smart garbage bins
          have Ultrasonic Sensors placed on the lid which detects the garbage level in the bins. By this, the garbage
          bins can be monitored and the monitoring information can be obtained through the webpage. The level of the
          garbage is compared with the depth of the bins. This system comprises of an AVR family Microcontroller, Wi-fi
          modem, LCD display along with a buzzer & also a 12V transformer associated with it.
          The Wi-fi modem is used to send the data. The garbage status will be shown on the webpage. The level of the
          garbage collected in the bins will be shown on the LCD display. The webpage is quite useful, as the
          information is displayed in graphical representation & the garbage level will be displayed in different
          colors. The bins have been set with a limit after the garbage overflows the set limit the buzzer gets pressed
          which further sends alert to the user to empty the bin. The graphical representation is provided by the
          platform of IoT Gecko web development.
